So far, we have implemented the sprite animation for the main character,
player movement using mouse clicks, randomized enemy spawning, and enemy collision
detection. Moving forward, we need to complete the abilities for the player and
its projectiles, the power ups, and the points system, as well as improve the overall
look of our game.
